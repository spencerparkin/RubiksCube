    <h1>A Rubik's Cube Implementation</h1>

    <p>This page documents a wxWidgets/OpenGL/C++ implementation of the Rubik's Cube.</p>
	
	<center><img src="ScreenShot.JPG"/></center>
    
	<h2>Basic Usage</h2>
	
	<p>When the application is launched, you're initially presented
	with a standard 3x3x3 Rubik's Cube.  You can, however, change this
	by using the "Program" menu to create a new cube of higher order.
	The requested cube size determines the width, height and
	depth of the cube.  After creating a cube, click and drag
	the left mouse button in the window to orient the cube.
	Click and drag the right mouse button over faces of the cube
	to manipulate it.  Also in the "Program" menu, you'll find
	a "Scramble Cube" option which you can use to randomize the cube
	by applying a randomly generated sequence of rotations.</p>
	
	<h3>Command Sequences</h3>
	
	<p>
	An alternative mode of cube manipulation is to use the command
	prompt at the bottom of the window, above the status bar.
	Here you can type a comma-delimeted sequence of rotation commands.
	The valid commands are "L", "R", "B", "F", "D", "U", without quotes,
	as well as their inverted counter-parts, which are given with an "i"
	appended.  For example, "Li" is the left-inverse command, and "Di"
	is the down-inverse command.  Exactly what faces of the cube are
	associated with the left, right, front, back, down-side and up-side
	of the cube is determined by the cube's current orientation.  To see
	how the program is currently associating these commands with the
	various faces of the cube in its current orientation, select the
	"Show Perspective Labels" option from the "View" menu.
	</p>
	
	<p>Of course, these commands are only applicable to the 2x2x2 and 3x3x3 cubes.
	For cubes having a larger number of cut-planes, (i.e., cubes of dimension
	NxNxN with N>3), the command language above is extended to accomodate such
	cubes with an added syntax that provides a way to describe any desired rotation
	from a given perspective.  This is done by simply adding a colon, then a
	plane index to any command.  For example, "L:0, L:1" is equivalent to the
	sequence "L, Ri" for the 2x2x2 cube.  Notice that the indices are zero-based.
	</p>
	
	<p>Note that as of this writing,
	the "Solve Cube" feature should work for all NxNxN cubes with N>=3.
	I'm not sure when, if ever, I'll get around to solving the 2x2x2 case.
	Presumably, the 3x3x3 case could have used code that solves the 2x2x2 case,
	but I didn't think that far ahead.</p>
	
	<h3>Bandaging</h3>
	
	<p>
	You can apply your own bandaging to your cube.  The idea behind bandaging
	is to effectivly glue two or more cubies together, so that they can't behind
	separated.  In real-world practice, this can only be done between adjacent cubies.
	In virtual-practice, you can "glue" any two cubies together in the entire cube.
	Control-Left-click on a cubie to select one of its faces.  This selects the cubie face,
	the cubie itself, and possibly all cubies faces of that color.  In this case, we
	just care about the selected cubie.  With the cubie selected, Control-Shift-Left-click
	some other cubie.  Doing so, you're prompted for a bandaging color.  After picking
	one, you'll see the two cubies drawn with that color applied.  The two cubies are
	not "glued" together if you then select the "Enforce Bandaging" option in the "Program Menu."
	Note that enforcement is not aloud begin unless the cube is in the solved state.
	Expand the set of bandaged cubies by first Control-clicking a member of the bandaged set,
	then Control-Shift-clicking any non-member of the set.
	</p>
	
	<h3>Face Textures</h3>
	
	<p>
	There is some support for changing the textures used on the cube.  As of this writing,
	you can't change the individual textures on each little individual cubie, but you can
	change the textures applied to each side of the cube.  Control-Left-Right-click on a cubie
	to select one of its faces.  Then use the "Change Face Texture" option under the "View" menu.
	This will let you change the texture that is applied to all faces having the same color
	as the one you selected.  Use the "Stretch Texture Across Entire Face" option under the
	"View" menu so that your image is completely only once all appropriate cubies are positioned
	and oriented properly.  This adds an interesting, additional complexity to solving the cube.
	Note that as of this writing, the solving algorithm does not pay attention to the orientation
	of center-piece cubies; so while it will get all colors the same on every side of the cube,
	the orientation of the center cubies won't necessarily be correct.
