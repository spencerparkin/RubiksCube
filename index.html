    <h1>A Rubik's Cube Implementation</h1>

    <p>This page documents a wxWidgets/OpenGL/C++ implementation of the Rubik's Cube.
    Download the latest version of the executable for 32-bit windows at the following link,
    or clone and build the Rubik's Cube project for yourself.</p>
    
	<a href="RubiksCube.exe">RubiksCube.exe</a>
	
	<p>To clone the project, issue the following command.</p>
	
	<code>
git clone https://github.com/spencerparkin/RubiksCube.git
	</code>
    
	<p>Once up, use the "program" menu to create a new cube.
	The requested cube size determines the width, height and
	depth of the cube.  After creating a cube, click and drag
	the left mouse button in the window to orient the cube.
	Click and drag the right mouse button over faces of the cube
	to manipulate it.  Also in the "program" menu, you'll find
	a scramble option which you can use to randomize the cube.</p>
	
	<p>Please let me know if you have any comments or questions
	about the program.  My next task in continuing to develop
	this program is that of adding some sort of solving algorithm
	that can manipulate the cube back into the solved state.</p>
