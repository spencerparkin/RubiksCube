    <h1>A Rubik's Cube Implementation</h1>

    <p>This page documents a wxWidgets/OpenGL/C++ implementation of the Rubik's Cube.
    Download the latest version of the executable for 32-bit windows at the following link,
    or clone and build the Rubik's Cube project for yourself.</p>
    
	<a href="RubiksCube.zip">RubiksCube.zip</a>
	
	<p>To clone the project, issue the following command.</p>
	
	<code>
git clone https://github.com/spencerparkin/RubiksCube.git
	</code>
    
	<h2>Basic Usage</h2>
	
	<p>Once running, use the "Program" menu to create a new cube.
	The requested cube size determines the width, height and
	depth of the cube.  After creating a cube, click and drag
	the left mouse button in the window to orient the cube.
	Click and drag the right mouse button over faces of the cube
	to manipulate it.  Also in the "Program" menu, you'll find
	a "Scramble Cube" option which you can use to randomize the cube
	by applying a randomly generated sequence of rotations.</p>
	
	<p>
	An alternative mode of cube manipulation is to use the command
	prompt at the bottom of the window, above the status bar.
	Here you can type a comma-delimeted sequence of rotation commands.
	The valid commands are "L", "R", "B", "F", "D", "U", without quotes,
	as well as their inverted counter-parts, which are given with an "i"
	appended.  For example, "Li" is the left-inverse command, and "Di"
	is the down-inverse command.  Exactly what faces of the cube are
	associated with the left, right, front, back, down-side and up-side
	of the cube is determined by the cube's current orientation.  To see
	how the program is currently associating these commands with the
	various faces of the cube in its current orientation, select the
	"Show Perspective Labels" option from the "View" menu.
	</p>
	
	<p>Of course, these commands are only applicable to the 2x2x2 and 3x3x3 cubes.
	For cubes having a larger number of cut-planes, (i.e., cubes of dimension
	NxNxN with N>3), the command language above is extended to accomodate such
	cubes with an added syntax that provides a way to describe any desired rotation
	from a given perspective.  This is done by simply adding a colon, then a
	plane index to any command.  For example, "L:0, L:1" is equivalent to the
	sequence "L, Ri" for the 2x2x2 cube.  Notice that the indices are zero-based.

	<p>Please let me know if you have any comments or questions
	about the program.  My e-mail address can be found in the
	about-box of the program.  Note that as of this writing,
	the "Solve Cube" feature works only for the 3x3x3 case.</p>
